The Simulated Markets Project was started by Evan Albers as a part of his undergraduate honors thesis at Bowdoin College. 

The central idea is straightforward. Financial Economics has historically been characterized by analytic approaches to modeling asset pricing dynamics. These approaches come at a cost, typically in the form of oenerous restrictions on agent behavior; often economists will assume agents have homogenous beliefs, for example. The Simulated Markets project seeks to move beyond this restriction by using agent-based models (ABMs) to simulate asset markets. Instead of relying on analytic optimization to calculate market equilibria, we simulate markets and observe equilibria as emergent phenomena. This allows for a far greater degree of agent specification than analytic approaches have permitted in the past. 

There is, however, a catch. ABMs have significant expressive power, but with this power comes a significant drawback: how does one decide which models matter? We can represent an arbitrary number of worlds, but only a small subset of these worlds have any economic relevance. This project, therefore, concerns itself as much with establishing the relevance of ABMs as it does with modeling economic phenomena. Often this is established by building models that reflect analytic approaches, and then subtly complicating the models by relaxing assumptions in an effort to achieve the desired phenomena.
