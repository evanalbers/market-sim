# market-sim

Actually running the simulation involves following the instructions detailed in the Maxe subrepository. See the README in the MAXE subdirectory for more details. I would advise running the starter example simulation located in docs, that also contains instructions for doing so. 

To run the simulation executable (after building), navigate to maxe/build/TheSimulator/TheSimulator, and then execute by running ./TheSimulator somesimulation.xml

Of course replace the xml filename with the file of the simulation you wish to run.
